-This task was requested from me to make a Model that can prediction if it's going to be rainy tomorrow based on the rain today, and other features...


-I divided the project into to tasks:
  + data analysis where I understand, plot and find correlations and relations between data preprocessing the data cleaning, feature engineering...

  + then comes the Model stage where I build the AI model than will predict the output -in this case whether tomorrow will have rain or not-, 
    training, testing, tweaking the model, and even trying differnet AI models until we reach the desired accuracy.
